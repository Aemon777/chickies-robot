# Chic-Fil-A robot project.
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robot capable of rolling from inside the lower ENS to the CFA building and back.

# Catkin_ws
This is our catkin workspace for ROS, holding our code relating to ROS. The bulk of our project code is located here.

# Playground
This folder should be used primarily for messing around and testing new ideas and systems. Our primary microcontroller scripts are in thihs folder.

# Resources
This folder is intended for all files not pertaining directly to running the robot. Right now this includes 3D print files, tutorials for project processes, and sample code. It also contains our comports.yaml file which compiles all Serial access data for the robot--don't move it without finding all locations it is referenced first.
