# Chic-Fil-A robot project.
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robot capable of rolling from inside the lower ENS to the CFA building and back.

# Catkin_ws
This is our catkin workspace for ROS, holding our code relating to ROS.

# Playground
This folder should be used primarily for messing around and testing new ideas and systems. Over time, we'll probably want to make new things work in separate branches using src, but this is a start.

# Resources
This folder is intended for all files not pertaining directly to running the robot. Right now this includes 3D print files, tutorials for project processes, and sample code.

# Src
This folder is for our main modules and source code that doesn't work based on ROS.
