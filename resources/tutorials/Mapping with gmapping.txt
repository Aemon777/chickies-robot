Using the gmapping process has two steps

    1.  Build a bag file for the gmapping process to run on
        The gmapping slam process runs by parsing data stored in a bag file
        This means the data gathering is done ahead of time, so we need to set up data gathering

        A.  Turn on the remote control. This is so the next step won't send the robot spinning.
        B.  run 
                "roslaunch system_launch make_map.launch"
            This is the launch file that runs all systems needed for the rosbag file
        C.  run "rviz"
        D.  In rviz, go to the upper left and change global frame to odom
        E.  Then give the robot an initial pose. Anywhere will do. Set it parallel to a grid line?
        F.  Once you've done this, run "rostopic echo tf" to make sure the /robot_pose_ekf/odom_combined is working
                You should see some sort of tf data for odom to base_footprint
        G.  Go into the chickies-robot/catkin_ws/maps folder and run   
                "rosbag record -O <file_name> /scan /tf /tf_static"
        H.  Drive the robot through the area you want mapped.
    
    2.  Run slam while replaying the bag file
        A.  Run "rosparam set use_sim_time true"
        B.  From anywhere, run "rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=scan"
        C.  From the chickies-robot/catkin_ws/maps directory, run
                rosbag play --clock <file_name>.bag
        D.  When the bag has played all the way out, run
                rosrun map_server map_saver -f <file_name>
