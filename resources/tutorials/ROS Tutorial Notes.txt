Random notes
    Master manages the various topics that exist
    Nodes run code, publish and subscribe
    Topics are basically names of buses that can be created by any node that publishes or subscribes to them -- tracked by Master in roscore

Node types that have come up
    turtlesim turtlesim_node
        This makes a turtle that can move around, random design, kinda cute ngl
    turtle_turtlesim teleop_key
        Finds turtle and commands it to do stuff (publishing to the /)
    rqt_graph rqt_graph
        Makes a graph that tracks current nodes and topic connections
    rqt_plot rqt_plot
        Makes a plot tracking data published on a given topic
        
Commands I decided to write down

    rosnode
        rosnode list 
            Shows all the current rosnodes running
        rosnode info <node_name>
            Shows specific info about selected node
        rosnode ping <node_name>
    rosrun
        rosrun <package_name> <node_name> {can add modifiers like __name:=turtle1}
            Creates a node of the node_name type from package_name
    rostopic
        rostopic echo <topic>
            Echoes all commands posted on a given topic
        rostopic list
            Lists topics

        rostopic pub <options> <topic> <msg_type> <args>
            Publishes a message of the given type to the specified topic with the given args
                Common options: --once/-1 to only send the message for like 3 seconds
                    -r # to have the command repeat at a frequency given by # Hertz
        rostopic hz <topic>
            Shows rate of publish on that topic
        rostopic type <topic> | rosmsg show
            Prints the format of messages to be published on the given topic
